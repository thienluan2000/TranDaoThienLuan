List of Identified Computational Inefficiencies and Anti-patterns

1/Unnecessary useMemo Dependencies:
The useMemo dependency array includes prices, but prices is not used within the memoized calculation of sortedBalances.

2/Inefficient filter and sort Logic:
The filter and sort logic within useMemo is convoluted and may not efficiently handle the conditions, especially with getPriority checks.
Using getPriority multiple times is computationally expensive, especially if balances is large.

3/Incorrect Conditional Logic in filter:
The lhsPriority variable is undefined within the filter callback. The intention seems to be checking the balance's priority and amount.

4/Unnecessary Mapping for Formatted Balances:
Mapping sortedBalances to create formattedBalances is redundant since formatting can be integrated into the same process.

5/Unstable Keys for List Items:
Using the index as a key in the rows map can lead to unstable keys, causing issues in React rendering.

6/TypeScript Types Misuse:
The balance object in the rows map is treated as FormattedWalletBalance, but it's actually of type WalletBalance.
